Local Installation, I assume you have local server like Xampp

Create a database locally named news 

Import the news.sql 

Download composer https://getcomposer.org/download/

Pull Laravel/php project from git provider.

Rename .env.example file to .env inside your project root and fill the database information. (windows wont let you do it, so you have to open your console cd your project root directory and run mv .env.example .env )

On my .env file i was using my gmail and had something like this on email information.

MAIL_DRIVER=smtp

MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

MAIL_PORT=587

MAIL_USERNAME=yourEmail

MAIL_PASSWORD=yourPassword

MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls

Remember to change global mail address in config/mail.php and turn the option "Allow less secure apps" ON if you will use gmail.

Open the console and cd your project root directory

Run composer install or php composer.phar install

Run php artisan serve

if everything goes well You can now access your project at localhost:8000
